   - Domains/Areas/Functions security frameworks, regulations, etc

# Performance Management 
  - TRUSTAPP
  - Baldrige Cybersecurity excellence center

# Data Sources
  - People 
    - organization chart, s/p professional teams, skillsets
    - RACI, Job definition, training, simulations
    - NICE, Mitre ATT&CK
  - Process 
    - COBIT, ITIL, ISO NIST and other frameworks, UCF
    - process/procedure document, flowchart, team chart, process stats, email mining
  - Technology 
     - restructure like puzzel, appsolite, vendors
     - cyber security tools landscape
     - each vendor's position in value chain or attack chain
     - samples
       -  top 20 open source tools for blue teams, DFIR too chain,
       -  developer tool chain (IDE languge or platform) 
       -  data analytics tool chain
       -  CMMC recommendations - org size

# Data Storage
  - Databases 
    - documentDB, 
    - timeseries Casandra, 
    - Facebook NeuralDB (unstructured to structured),
    - KowledgeGraph - tigergraph
  - Cloud Data Storage 
    - data lake, catalog, etc

# Data Processing 
  - Image/ Video 
    - vendor demos, tools screenshots
  - Documents - NLP 
    - AWS Textract, MonkeyLearn, Diffbot, OpenAI
    - MRC ( machine reading comprehension) 
    - ICAA (Intelligent Context Aware Agent)
    - classifier, topic, similarity 
  - Structured data 
    - AWS dataprep / OpenRefine 

# By AI/ML Ops
  - Context/Data (Cleansing Recipes)
  - Analytical Engine (HITL)
  - Recommendation Engine 
    - maturity/risk target, what-if, choices, expert advices
    - data from known trusted curated contents, relavent to the context, timely
  - Decision Journals
  - Implementation Engine 
    - artifacts/data collected during or after implementation 

# Sample Use Cases
  - Review a policy document 
    - file property, cluster of documents correlate to framework, document layout, 
    - document classification (mapping to control), topic summary,    
    - words counts to ontology,  sentences breackdown and mapping to controls
  - Review a cluster of documents 
    - 20+ elements (revision history, approval, dates, etc), 
    - compliant with X framework, missed    
    - policy to process/procedures or requirements
    - policy coded/enforced at technical control level
  - Review SOC2 / Questionaire 
    - convert documents to data tables
    - list of controls/pratices/results
    - gaps/findings/recommendations
    - compare across vendors 
    - align responses to regulations or frameworks
  - assess security process maturity
  - evalute security toolchains 
  - assess organziation strucutre and people capability
  - facility commnications - internal and with consultanting
  - aggregate publicly available data and provide context based situation awareness
  - recommend staffing and budget based on desired goals
  

# Core Technology 
  - HITL human in the loop AI
    - with advisors from consulting firms
