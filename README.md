# Performance Management 
  - TRUSTAPP
  - Baldrige Cybersecurity excellence center

# Data Sources
  - People 
    - organization identity stores, org chart, s/p professional teams, skillsets
    - RACI, Job description, certifications, training, simulations
    - NICE, Mitre ATT&CK & D3FEND
  - Process 
    - program framework: ISO, NIST CSF
    - control framework: COBIT, ITIL, HITRUST, UCF
    - architecture framewrok: TOGAF
    - data governance framework
    - risk framework: OCTAVE, NIST 800
    - maturity framework: CMMI, NIST CSF, CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model
    - certification: FedRAMP, ISO, HITRUST, CMMC
    - Audit: SOC1, SOC2, security assessments, data/developer pipeline
    - process/procedure document, flowchart, team chart, process stats, email mining
  - Technology 
     - restructure like puzzel, appsolite, vendors
     - cyber security tools landscape
     - each vendor's position in value chain or attack chain
     - samples
       -  top 20 open source tools for blue teams, DFIR too chain,
       -  developer tool chain (IDE languge or platform) 
       -  data analytics tool chain
       -  CMMC recommendations - org size

# Data Storage
  - Databases 
    - documentDB, 
    - timeseries Casandra, 
    - Facebook NeuralDB (unstructured to structured),
    - KowledgeGraph - tigergraph
  - Cloud Data Storage 
    - data lake, catalog, etc

# Data Processing 
  - Image/ Video /Audio 
    - vendor demos, tools screenshots
    - assessment recordings
  - Documents - NLP 
    - AWS Textract, MonkeyLearn, Diffbot, OpenAI
    - MRC ( machine reading comprehension) 
    - ICAA (Intelligent Context Aware Agent)
    - knowledge graph
    - layout, classifier, topic, similarity, grade - level of comformance, gaps, samples 
  - Structured data 
    - AWS dataprep / OpenRefine 
  - batch vs real time data

# By AI/ML Ops
  - Context/Data (Cleansing Recipes)
  - Analytical Engine (HITL)
  - Recommendation Engine 
    - maturity/risk target, what-if, choices, expert advices
    - data from known trusted curated contents, relavent to the context, timely
  - Decision Journals
  - Implementation Engine 
    - artifacts/data collected during or after implementation 

# Real Time Asset Safegurd Intelligence

# Cybersecurity Command Center
  - intelligent asset & safeguards graph 
  - system of accountability
  - system of assessment automation (gap, risk and maturity) 
  - body of work and shared space
  - system of insights and recommendations
  - system of knowledge and records
  
# Pain Points in Enterprise
  - assets not clearly cataloged, no criticality/no value assigned
  - safeguards not aligned to business and IT transformation
  - impacts of safeguard on asset not clearly quantified 
  - top down or  bottom up accountability for asset owner and defender not aligned
  - tons of manual data enentry for internal/vendor/outbound audits/assessments
  - manually mapping internal requimemts to supply chain 3rd and 4th party 
  - difficult to validate for cyber insuance and potential crisis like ransomware 
  - hard to map internal controls to supply chain vendors for equivalent or better control
  - no continous workstreams for cyber security 
  - difficult to set monthly or quarterly improvement target with concret work efforts
  - lots of projects/workstream, not continously improved or measured, no single source of truth
  - lack of vision for what are possible and what is best fit given a context

# Sample Use Cases
  - Review a policy document 
    - file property, cluster of documents correlate to framework, document layout, 
    - document classification (mapping to control), topic summary,    
    - words counts to ontology,  sentences breackdown and mapping to controls
  - Review a cluster of documents 
    - 20+ elements (revision history, approval, dates, etc), 
    - compliant with X framework, missed    
    - policy to process/procedures or requirements
    - policy coded/enforced at technical control level
  - Review SOC2 / Questionaire 
    - convert documents to data tables
    - list of controls/pratices/results
    - gaps/findings/recommendations
    - compare across vendors 
    - align responses to regulations or frameworks
  - assess security process maturity
  - evalute security toolchains 
  - assess organziation strucutre and people capability
  - facilitate communications - internal and with consultanting
  - aggregate publicly available data and provide context based situation awareness
  - recommend staffing and budget based on desired goals
  

# Core Technology 
  - HITL human in the loop AI
    - with advisors from consulting firms
    - practicians (your teams)
    - QA knoweledge engine
  - RPA Robotic Processing Automation

# Features 
  - help the organizations to with perspetives at different level of view - 100K, 50K, 5000, etc
  - help CISO for acountability, strategy, operations and projects, progress, metrics
  - help program managers with choices, recommendations, etc
  - help analysis with literature (search, summary, ranking), data recipes, workflow refinement, automate artifact collections
  - context aware, adapative to changes, semi-automation, cognitive (situaton awareness and self learning), recipes, results oriented, values (to all in the chain) 

# Next Generation System Attributes
  - multimodal drivers: by data, event, change delta, results, process, workflow, not just task
  - human centric user experiences: know the user, guide the user, assist the user
  - context aware: recipes /recomendations/ choices based given corporate environment
  - adative to changes:internal changes, external factor changes, benchmark changes, etc
  - flexibility: toolbox for users to create subfunctions that system does not provide
  - fluid UI: users can reorganize views and perspective with same backend
  - model store: users can replace sample data with their data and see results right away
