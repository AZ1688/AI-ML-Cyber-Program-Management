# AI/ML in Cyber Program Management

# Features 
  - help the organizations to with perspetives at different level of view - 100K, 50K, 5000, etc
  - help CISO for acountability, strategy, operations and projects, progress, metrics
  - help program managers with choices, recommendations, etc
  - help analysis with literature (search, summary, ranking), data recipes, workflow refinement, automate artifact collections
  - context aware, adapative to changes, semi-automation, cognitive (situaton awareness and self learning), recipes, results oriented, values (to all in the chain)

# Program by AI/ML Ops
  - Context/Data (Cleansing Recipes) - 
  - Analytical Engine (HITL) - 
  - Recommendation Engine (target, what-if, choices, expert advices) - data from known trusted curated contents, relavent to the context,
  - Decision Engine - 
  - Implementation Engine - artifacts/data collected during or after implementation 

# Data Processing 
  - Image/ Video 
    - vendor demos, tools screenshots
  - Documents - NLP 
    - AWS Textract, MonkeyLearn, Diffbot, OpenAI
  - Structured data 
    - AWS dataprep / OpenRefine 

# Data Storage
  - Databases - documentDB, timeseries Casandra, Facebook NeuralDB, KowledgeGraph - tigergraph
  - Cloud Data Storage 

# Performance Management 
  - TRUSTAPP
  - Baldrige Cybersecurity excellence center

# Data Sources
  - People 
    - organization chart, s/p professional teams, skillsets
    - RACI, Job definition, training, simulations
  - Process 
    - COBIT, ITIL, ISO NIST and other frameworks, UCF
    - process/procedure document, flowchart, team chart, process stats, email mining
  - Technology 
     - restructure like puzzel, appsolite, vendors
     - cyber security tools landscape
     - each vendor's position in value chain or attack chain
     - samples
       - top 20 open source tools for blue teams, DFIR too chain,
       -  developer tool chain (IDE languge or platform) 
       -  data analytics tool chain

# Sample Use Cases
  - Review a policy document 
    - file property, cluster of documents correlate to framework, document layout, 
    - document classification (mapping to control), topic summary,    
    - words counts to ontology,  sentences breackdown and mapping to controls
  - Review a cluster of documents 
    - 20+ elements (revision history, approval, dates, etc), 
    - compliant with X framework, missed    
    - policy to process/procedures or requirements
    - policy coded/enforced at technical control level
  - Review SOC2 / Questionaire 
    - convert documents to data tables
    - list of controls/pratices/results
    - gaps/findings/recommendations
    - compare across vendors 
  

# Core Technology 
  - HITL human in the loop AI
    - with advisors from consulting firms
    - practicians (your teams)
    - QA knoweledge engine
  - RPA: 
     -  salesforce lighting flow, process automation, predict with einstein discovery
  - No/Low Code, 
  - Recommendation Engine 
  - cloud native, app composability
