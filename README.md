# Cyber Security Program

  - CISO Mindmap https://rafeeqrehman.com/2021/07/11/ciso-mindmap-2021-what-do-infosec-professionals-really-do/
   - Domains/Areas/Functions security frameworks, regulations, etc

# Program by AI/ML Ops
  - Context/Data (Cleansing Recipes) - 
  - Analytical Engine (HITL) - 
  - Recommendation Engine (target, what-if, choices, expert advices) - data from known trusted curated contents, relavent to the context,
  - Decision Engine - 
  - Implementation Engine - artifacts/data collected during or after implementation 

# Semistructured/Unstructure Data Processing 
  - Image Processing - vendor screenshots, 
  - NLP - AWS Textract, MonkeyLearn, Diffbot, OpenAI
  - Structured data - AWS dataprep / OpenRefine 

# Data Storage
  - Databases - documentDB, timeseries Casandra, Facebook NeuralDB, KowledgeGraph - tigergraph
  Cloud Data Storage 

# Performance Management 
  - TRUSTAPP
  - Baldrige Cybersecurity excellence center

# Data Sources
  - People - organization chart, s/p professional teams, skillsets, RACI, Job definition, training, simulations
  - Process - COBIT, ITIL, process/procedure document, flowchart, team chart, process stats, email mining
  - Technology - restructure like puzzel, appsolite, vendors

# Sample Use Cases
  - Review a policy document - file property, cluster of documents correlate to framework, document layout, document classification (mapping to control), topic summary,    words counts to ontology,  sentences breackdown and mapping to controls
  - Review a cluster of documents - 20+ elements (revision history, approval, dates, etc), compliant with X framework, missed    policy requirements
  - Review SOC2 / Questionaire - convert documents to data tables, list of controls/pratices/results, gaps/findings/recommendations, compare across vendors 
  

# Core Technology 
  - HITL, RPA, No/Low Code, Recommendation Engine
